  content: 'currently searching for my “supreme” good. <br>I’m enrolled in the most
    mesmerizing management class and we learned that every act of will is oriented
    to an ultimate “supreme” good that draws our freedom to it. Essentially, your
    “supreme” good is the superordinate goal that rules your whole life. While uncovering
    your “supreme” good, you might find either the world of measurement (WOM) or the
    world of possibility (WOP).<br><br>WOM = Life is arranged in measured hierarchies:
    some groups, people, bodies, places, and ideas are better than others. Competition
    is the way to success. In this world, the supreme good of work is *having* —money,
    fame, power, success<br><br>WOP = Life appears as variety, pattern, and shimmering
    movement, inviting us to engage. Action is generative and giving. Spiritual emotions
    abundant: joy, grace, awe, wholeness, passion, compassion. In this world, the
    supreme good of work is being—esp. being a contribution<br><br><br>Which world/good
    do you prefer? Which is greater? Which is more realistic?<br><br>At first, I preferred
    WOP, but thought WOM was more realistic. After putting in more thought, I understood
    that WOM is actually very materialistic and “man-made” while WOP is more “naturally
    human” which makes it more realistic.'
